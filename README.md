## 3.0 Networking Devices
- **Switch (Layer 2 Device)** - Learn mac address much more quickly using hardware ASICS (Application Specific Integrated Circuits).
- **Ethernet Cable / Hubs (Layer 1 Devices)**
- **Router (Layer 3 Device)s** - Routing the transmissions.
- **Bridge (Layer 2 Device)** - Learns mac addresses in software.

## 4.0 Firewalls
Physical firewalls rely between switch and router because router should deal with ISP (Because router supports various technologies such as ADSL / Wireless capability (4G, 3G).

## 5.0 IPS and IDS
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** - Blocks if  malicious activity alerts. Resides within the network flow.
- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** - Taking copies from network flow and warns.
